### UnscriptedLogic's Loading Program

Player movement speed change smoothing has not been implemented yet. No idea on how to work around it for now.
Working on creating a flexible inventory system so it may be applied to even non-player objects to potentially make storage containers.

Stuff to add on a later date
- Models and Prefabs yet to be uploaded
- Character model not yet implemented
