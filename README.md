### UnscriptedLogic's Loading Program

This is a sandbox game made solely by me. It is a place for me to discover, test, play and create game ideas and mechanics. 
On some days, I may need an open space to test models and materials-making sure they look good on screen and ready to import them to any game, on other days I may need a safe place 
to test volatile interactions with mechanics or experimental shaders that may break my games and on somedays, messing around may just be what I need to spark
the creativity I need to make the next game or game mechanic.
